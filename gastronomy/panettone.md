# Panettone - a.k.a. The Expanding Universe

Panettone is the dessert that Italian astrophysicists love the most to explain the expansion of the Universe. As for the Universe, the expansion of the Panettone is a mess to describe and usually requires some fine-tuning to obtain the final product. Here space-time is made out of gluten-egg-butter mixture (clusters and filaments), raisins/chocolate chips/candied fruit (visible matter), alveoli (voids), and yeast (dark energy).
