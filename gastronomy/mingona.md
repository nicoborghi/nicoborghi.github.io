# Mingona - Chestnut Fudgy Cake

Mingona (castagnaccio, *miaza*) is a dense chestnut flour cake that became popular when chestnuts were "the bread of the poor" [1]. Pellegrino Artusi codified this preparation in 1891 as "Migliaccio di farina dolce volgarmente castagnaccio" (Recipe 240) [2]. The name *mingona*, used in the Bologna and Ferrara area, likely derives from the dialectal diminutives of Domenico or Domenica (e.g., Minghéin, Mingòun; feminine: Minghéina, Mingòuna), perhaps referring to the person who originally made the cake popular here.

Regional variants include: Tuscan ("Castagnaccio": pine nuts, walnuts, raisins, rosemary); Piedmontese (apples, milk); Ligurian (fennel seeds); more modern domestic (cocoa powder). Historically, chestnut flour was more economically accessible in Italy, requiring minimal processing beyond desiccation and milling.

## Ingredients
The following table provides quantities suitable for serving 10 people with a moderate appetite. Total mass: 700 g

| Component        | [v1 water] Q.ty (g) | [v2 milk] Q.ty (g) |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Chestnut flour   | 300                 | 300                |
| Water            | 350                 | -                  |
| Milk             | -                   | 350                |
| Cocoa powder     | 15                  | 15                 | 
| Seed oil         | 60                  | 60                 | 
| Sugar (optional) | 30                  | 30                 | 
| Salt             | 2                   | 2                  | 

*Note: Traditional formulations exclude sugar, relying exclusively on the flour's inherent sweetness (≈20-25% simple sugars). Modern palates may prefer its inclusion.*

## Method

1. **Flour**: Sift the chestnut flour to remove lumps and to ensure uniform hydration.

2. **Hydration**: Create a slurry by gradually incorporating the liquid (water or milk) to the flour while whisking continuously to obtain a smooth, viscous-liquid batter.

    - v1: water, enhanced chestnut flavor.

    - v2: milk, more traditional cake taste.

3. **Lipids**: Divide the oil into two parts: emulsify ~⅔ directly into the batter, and keep the remaining ~⅓ for the surface.

4. **Flavors**: Add cocoa powder, salt, and optional sugar. Mix until completely dissolved.

5. **Pan preparation and assembly**: Oil a 24–26 cm pan. Pour the batter, level the surface, and apply the remaining oil as a thin film

6. **Cooking**: Bake at 180 °C (convection) or 190 °C (static) for 35–40 minutes. Indicators of doneness: characteristic surface fissures, lightly browned edges.

## Discussion

- Sadly, this is one of the latest conversations I had with my grandmother at the end of 2025. She used to prepare it with milk, adding two spoons of sweet cocoa powder, and covering it with a thin layer of oil before baking. This ensures the cake remains moist and prevents excessive drying of the surface. I personally prefer the water version, as it enhances the chestnut flavor.

- In my hometown, a denser version of this batter is used to prepare *ciaciar* (fried chestnut flour pancakes). They are typically prepared for the 6th of January (Epiphany) celebrations.

- **Textural considerations**: The absence of gluten networks and chemical leavening agents results in a dense, fudgy matrix. Internal structure depends on starch gelatinization and protein denaturation rather than gas cell stabilization.
