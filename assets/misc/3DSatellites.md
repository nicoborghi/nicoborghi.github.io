# How to (not) paint 3D satellites

1. Find you preferred 3D satellite from the ESA website. Thankfully, we have a lot of options, compatible with a lot of 3D printers. 

2. Prepare your 3D printer. If you don't have one find a friend who has it or, better, works with it. Finer details can be obtained with the dust-resin printer. I must thank Serena (Bedeschi, Solid Works s.r.l.) for providing me the resin model shown in Fig 1a.

3. Decide whether to use acrylic paint or spray cans. The first option allows you to obtain finer details. The second one provide you a smoother result in a shorter amount of time if you are not an experienced painter. 

4. Clean the print. Instrument a too long, instrument b too overkill and risky. Third would be ultrasound but did not have it. I use a and b spending and lot of time while uno dietro l'altro breaking pieces of it. 

5. Work in water. As these are microplastics is better for to to work in water, then collect them with a towel and not puor in the sink.

6. Separate fragile parts and if necessary reinforce them. The models migth be scientific corrrect  but contain parts difficult to reproduce, or very weak, so you have to reiforse them

7. Prepare the base. A wooden base would be elegant the alternative is printing it or finding an object to do it. As my dad works with wood it was easy and has a lot of fun (hopefully). I also found a bycicle light with rechargable battery
